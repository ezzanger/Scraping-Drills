Technical Drafting Position Available

Lam-Wood Systems, Inc. supplies structural wood products to the construction and high end residential market. We supply many different structural wood products and our shop drawings differ based upon which product we are supplying. As an example, when supplying an I-joist project, our shop drawings show the placement of the materials within the project and we will also run a joist analysis utilizing proprietary manufacturers software to ensure that the joist work for the given loads and framing condition. For projects that involve custom/complex, cut-to-shape Heavy Timber/Glulam or Heavy Timber/Glulam Trusses we create a 3d model to ensure that the material fits within the project properly and to also aid in creating cutting profiles for each individual piece of wood. Each project we work on is different from previous projects, thus providing you with years of enjoyment working for a firm that keeps you both mentally stimulated and challenged. 

Description and Requirements
	The position is an entry level job opening but experience is certainly a plus and pay will be commensurate with experience. Lam-Wood Systems Inc. is looking for an individual who is experienced with Autodesk AutoCAD or Architecture 2010 or later. Drafting or designing for a structural engineering firm is a plus but not a requirement since we will teach you what you need to know on the job. Since you will be producing shop drawings of engineered wood products, a structures class is highly desired but again, not required. You should have basic knowledge of geometry (trigonometry helpful), be detail oriented, have an ability to visualize in multiple dimensions (3d), and possess excellent communication skills. Familiarity with Microsoft office software is a must. You will also need to possess the ability to handle pressure while ""under the gun"" to meet schedule deadlines.


Benefits
Full Time position, paid vacation, medical reimbursement benefit, profit sharing plan, 401K. Major U.S. holidays paid off, your birthday off, sick leave, and your own office (no cubicles).


Lam-Wood Systems, Inc. offers a great work environment. We would love the opportunity to tell you more about our company. Some of our drafters have been with us for over 20 years...a testament to what a great place this is in which to work.

💥STOP!!! If you're ready to have your world ROCKED in 2019 then consider this 👇👇

WHY do so many people work MORE and settle for LESS when they see Real Estate (with their own two eyes) 👀 giving other people  FINANCIAL 💰freedom and TIME 🕑freedom? 
 BECAUSE...

Most people assume in order to successfully do real estate...

❌ you need a BIG START UP budget 💰💰💰, or...
❌ you need to have a REAL ESTATE LICENSE, or ...
❌ you need a lot of FREE TIME 🕑🕑🕑...

When in REALITY with all the new technology now at our fingertips...

... real estate can be a very SIMPLE process WHEN you're working with the right...

✅ Strategy

Come see for yourself the #1 Denver ""Side Hustle"" 👉Strategy 👈for 2019 at this FREE Live ""In Person"" Event:
👉 

💥This 2019 ""Side Hustle"" is the NEW COUNTERINTUITIVE 🙃way for ANYONE to do real estate. It's going to literally rock your world when you see it!!

Hi, my name is Chris. You may have seen me around Facebook quite a bit lately and that's because...

I'm on a MISSION to help busy FRUSTRATED Denver professionals TAKE BACK CONTROL in 2019...

... and experience real financial freedom by breaking free from the grind of being OVERworked and UNDERpaid.

Listen...

I used to be the frustrated ""9 to 5 Grinder"" who had very little financial success to show for my OVERworked lifestyle. 

👉Been there. 
👉Done that.
👉Even got the t-shirt.

Working HARDER in 2019 is NOT the answer. That strategy is OUTDATED and gone the way of the DINOSAUR 🦖 

Try this instead...

... it's the same ONE simple COUNTERINTUITIVE 🙃strategy I used to take back control. 

🎯The BEST part: I worked real estate as a part-time ""side hustle."" 

In fact, I didn't just work it 👉 I PERFECTED the blueprint for the side hustle life! 

I've now been using this blueprint for just about two years...

... and thanks to this one COUNTERINTUITIVE 🙃strategy I've been experiencing INCREDIBLE success....

... and helping others just like you experience the same.

Why is this counterintuitive 🙃? 

Because this side hustle strategy requires you to actually work LESS so you can make MORE and...

... get MORE lifestyle back in the process. 

Now don't get me wrong, this does take work, but it's NOT any harder than what you're already doing and the UPSIDE is WAAAAAAAAAY more fun and lucrative!

I've personally used this counterintuitive strategy to make more in just 17 months than I made during my entire 6 year career as an officer in the military...

...and I did it all by getting started WITHOUT a real estate license or any prior experience. 

But here's the IRONY...

I was held back from getting into Real Estate for over 10 years because I would say things like...

💥I don't know how to market...
💥I don't know how to find deals...
💥I don't know where to begin...
💥I don't have the time...
💥I don't have a real estate license...
💥I don't have money to invest...

If you've had any of these thoughts yourself then I'm here to tell you...

... these thoughts are holding you back too from the opportunity to create a truly AMAZING life for you and your loved ones. 

📰 NEWS FLASH: You are closer to the FREEDOM you want than you realize. 

See for yourself at this FREE Live ""In Person"" Event where I'm going to share the #1 Denver ""Side Hustle"" Strategy for 2019:
👉 

How was I able to break free from the grind of being OVERworked and UNDERpaid in less than three short months? 

I started working with a LOCAL mentor who helped me COLLAPSE time by giving me access to this New Counterintuitive 🙃Strategy.

What I realized working with this LOCAL mentor is that it's PRICELESS to work with someone you can look in the eyes and work with face-to-face and...

...WAY MORE EFFECTIVE than it is trying to learn from someone who is hiding behind a computer. 

Because of my LOCAL mentor...

👉My IDEAS changed
👉My MINDSET changed
👉My ACTIONS changed
👉My BANK ACCOUNT BALANCE changed

With all of my newfound success I decided to invest over $43,750 of my own money to fine-tune this COUNTERINTUITIVE 🙃strategy so it would work for the busy professional who needs to get this done in their SPARE time and...

... who is starting WITHOUT a real estate license or any prior experience. 

BECAUSE I'm so passionate about helping busy OVERworked professionals break free into a life they love (and deserve)...

... I'm sharing (for FREE) the Exact Counterintuitive 🙃Strategy my mentors taught me.

I'm doing it at my live IN PERSON event here in Denver. 

Why trust someone HIDING behind their computer screen when we can shake hands face-to-face so you can judge for yourself how great this new real estate side hustle truly is. 

If you're a busy OVERworked professional...

✅ who is an Action Taker
✅ who is Not Afraid of Work
✅ who is 100% Committed to Your Success
✅ who is TIRED of all the get rich quick stuff that ultimately just lines someone else's pockets
✅ who is looking for a SMART way to use and grow your money that doesn't involve the uncertainty and Risk of drop-shipping or Shopify or Amazon or even Internet Marketing
✅ who wants to connect with someone LOCAL who is going to help you navigate through the real estate waters to ensure you make it in 2019

Then this was made for you! Go here now and reserve your spot before we fill up.
👉 

I look forward to seeing you at the live IN PERSON event where I'll unveil this ONE COUNTERINTUITIVE 🙃strategy I'm putting all of my own money behind in 2019 to create prosperity for both myself and those who want to tag along for the ride!
