 New York City's leading professional firm dedicated to the preservation of buildings and infrastructure is currently seeking an  
architect with 2 to 5 years of restoration experience.  

SUPERSTRUCTURES works on an array of challenging projects on many of New York's most prominent buildings. We've won frequent awards, as well as the loyalty of some of the premier clients in the region -- public, corporate and residential.  Our work embraces all components of the building envelope and underlying structure - facades, roofs, windows, and plazas - and the full complement of materials, from landmark terra cotta to high performance curtain walls. We take pride in being an industry leader in such practice areas as Local Law 11 inspections and repairs. 

We work in teams. Teams are assigned to projects based on synergies between project requirements and the capabilities of each team member. This arrangement offers employees the dual advantages of a ""small office experience"" coupled with access to the centralized resources of a larger firm. You'll be supported by some of the most sophisticated technology in the profession, including proprietary computer systems and applications, advanced photography and image processing, and state of the art non-destructive diagnostic equipment and techniques.  

Employees typically participate in all phases of a project from inception through completion: proposal, investigation, construction documents, bid negotiation, and construction administration. You'll have the opportunity to see the designs you draw executed in the field, and you'll take on greater responsibility and client exposure as soon as you are ready.  

Frequent lunchtime seminars by industry experts, including our own in-house personnel, keep us current on developments in the profession (with the additional benefit of a free lunch).  

SUPERSTRUCTURES offers top-level compensation for top-level people, and the advancement potential of a thriving company.  

We are committed to a work / life balance, and to a work week of 40 hours.  When, on occasion, more than 40 hours are required, our employees are compensated for every additional hour worked. 
Our benefits include paid holidays, vacation and sick days, health insurance for employee and family, 401(k) with automatic employer contribution, a continuing education allowance, and free NYC Transit MetroCards.  

Our light-filled office is in a landmarked building with 16' high ceilings, 8' tall windows, and drop dead views in three directions - not a bad place to spend the workday. 

Our Tribeca location is one of New York City's most convenient and vibrant, easily accessible via public transportation. The A, C, and E subway lines stop right in the building. The N, R, #1, and #6 lines are each just a few blocks away.

I'm looking for someone to help me develop a simple device to assist with the testing of small, battery-operated electronics.

I recently purchased a lot of hundreds of old Game Boy Pockets that I want to resell, but I need to test each end every one to see if they're all working first, so I don't inadvertently sell broken merchandise.  This product takes 2 AA batteries, but I don't have time to put in and take out the batteries hundreds of times.  Instead, I'd like to build a handheld (or some other type of) battery-pack which clips onto the back of each Game Boy that well allow me to test these Game Boy Pockets quickly and easily, without having to put batteries in and out of each one.

This so-called ""game-boy tester"" is simply a 2xAA battery pack, with a built-in clip that allows you to easily clip the battery pack onto the back of the Game Boy, where the battery terminals are.  The ""clip"" will probably have to be 3D-printed so it fits well.

I'm looking for someone who can build me a kick-ass tester - someone with experience with building/prototyping small gadgets and mechanical devices, 3D-printing, etc., who can use good materials and make something strong and sturdy that can withstand the testing of hundreds or thousands of pieces.

Please reply to this ad if you think you can help me build this thing.  I'm offering $250, but I'll most-likely want to enlist some helpers to help with the testing, so we may need to make additional testers, and I will pay another $100 for each additional tester (plus the cost of materials).

💥STOP!!! If you're ready to have your world ROCKED in 2019 then consider this 👇👇

WHY do so many people work MORE and settle for LESS when they see Real Estate (with their own two eyes) 👀 giving other people  FINANCIAL 💰freedom and TIME 🕑freedom? 
 BECAUSE...

Most people assume in order to successfully do real estate...

❌ you need a BIG START UP budget 💰💰💰, or...
❌ you need to have a REAL ESTATE LICENSE, or ...
❌ you need a lot of FREE TIME 🕑🕑🕑...

When in REALITY with all the new technology now at our fingertips...

... real estate can be a very SIMPLE process WHEN you're working with the right...

✅ Strategy

Come see for yourself the #1 Denver ""Side Hustle"" 👉Strategy 👈for 2019 at this FREE Live ""In Person"" Event:
👉 

💥This 2019 ""Side Hustle"" is the NEW COUNTERINTUITIVE 🙃way for ANYONE to do real estate. It's going to literally rock your world when you see it!!

Hi, my name is Chris. You may have seen me around Facebook quite a bit lately and that's because...

I'm on a MISSION to help busy FRUSTRATED Denver professionals TAKE BACK CONTROL in 2019...

... and experience real financial freedom by breaking free from the grind of being OVERworked and UNDERpaid.

Listen...

I used to be the frustrated ""9 to 5 Grinder"" who had very little financial success to show for my OVERworked lifestyle. 

👉Been there. 
👉Done that.
👉Even got the t-shirt.

Working HARDER in 2019 is NOT the answer. That strategy is OUTDATED and gone the way of the DINOSAUR 🦖 

Try this instead...

... it's the same ONE simple COUNTERINTUITIVE 🙃strategy I used to take back control. 

🎯The BEST part: I worked real estate as a part-time ""side hustle."" 

In fact, I didn't just work it 👉 I PERFECTED the blueprint for the side hustle life! 

I've now been using this blueprint for just about two years...

... and thanks to this one COUNTERINTUITIVE 🙃strategy I've been experiencing INCREDIBLE success....

... and helping others just like you experience the same.

Why is this counterintuitive 🙃? 

Because this side hustle strategy requires you to actually work LESS so you can make MORE and...

... get MORE lifestyle back in the process. 

Now don't get me wrong, this does take work, but it's NOT any harder than what you're already doing and the UPSIDE is WAAAAAAAAAY more fun and lucrative!

I've personally used this counterintuitive strategy to make more in just 17 months than I made during my entire 6 year career as an officer in the military...

...and I did it all by getting started WITHOUT a real estate license or any prior experience. 

But here's the IRONY...

I was held back from getting into Real Estate for over 10 years because I would say things like...

💥I don't know how to market...
💥I don't know how to find deals...
💥I don't know where to begin...
💥I don't have the time...
💥I don't have a real estate license...
💥I don't have money to invest...

If you've had any of these thoughts yourself then I'm here to tell you...

... these thoughts are holding you back too from the opportunity to create a truly AMAZING life for you and your loved ones. 

📰 NEWS FLASH: You are closer to the FREEDOM you want than you realize. 

See for yourself at this FREE Live ""In Person"" Event where I'm going to share the #1 Denver ""Side Hustle"" Strategy for 2019:
👉 

How was I able to break free from the grind of being OVERworked and UNDERpaid in less than three short months? 

I started working with a LOCAL mentor who helped me COLLAPSE time by giving me access to this New Counterintuitive 🙃Strategy.

What I realized working with this LOCAL mentor is that it's PRICELESS to work with someone you can look in the eyes and work with face-to-face and...

...WAY MORE EFFECTIVE than it is trying to learn from someone who is hiding behind a computer. 

Because of my LOCAL mentor...

👉My IDEAS changed
👉My MINDSET changed
👉My ACTIONS changed
👉My BANK ACCOUNT BALANCE changed

With all of my newfound success I decided to invest over $43,750 of my own money to fine-tune this COUNTERINTUITIVE 🙃strategy so it would work for the busy professional who needs to get this done in their SPARE time and...

... who is starting WITHOUT a real estate license or any prior experience. 

BECAUSE I'm so passionate about helping busy OVERworked professionals break free into a life they love (and deserve)...

... I'm sharing (for FREE) the Exact Counterintuitive 🙃Strategy my mentors taught me.

I'm doing it at my live IN PERSON event here in Denver. 

Why trust someone HIDING behind their computer screen when we can shake hands face-to-face so you can judge for yourself how great this new real estate side hustle truly is. 

If you're a busy OVERworked professional...

✅ who is an Action Taker
✅ who is Not Afraid of Work
✅ who is 100% Committed to Your Success
✅ who is TIRED of all the get rich quick stuff that ultimately just lines someone else's pockets
✅ who is looking for a SMART way to use and grow your money that doesn't involve the uncertainty and Risk of drop-shipping or Shopify or Amazon or even Internet Marketing
